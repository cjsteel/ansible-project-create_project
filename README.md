# README.md

## Descriptions

Sets up repositories for **development**, **staging** and **production** environments.
## Requirements

### Write access to target repository.

The means you need to have a passphrase protected SSH key pair on the local system with the ssh key loaded in memory. You will want to do, or have done something like the following:

#### Setup SSH Keys

If you do not have a passphrase keypair generate one as follows:

```shell

ssh-keygen

```

Place a copy of your public key on the target git server

### ssh agent

Load you passphrase into memory:

```shell

exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent $SHELL
ssh-add -t 3H

```

### setup your host file

```shell

mkdir inventory
touch inventory/dev
nano inventory/dev

```

#### content example

Example for developing and testing locally.

```ini

[development]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[staging]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[production]
localhost ansible_connection=local

```

### project/group_vars

#### create project/group_vars

Next create and generate contents of create_project/group_vars

```shell

mkdir -p group_vars/all
echo "---"                                                  > group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "# group_vars/all/create_project.yml"                  >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "#"                                                    >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "#"                                                    >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo ""                                                     >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_license_year    : '2016'"              >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_author          : 'Christopher Steel'" >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_license         : 'mit'"               >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_user            : 'cjs'"               >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_accept_hostkey  : True"                >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_project_name    : 'acemenu'"           >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_shared_repo_url : 'git@github.com:cjsteel/ansible-role-acemenu.git'" \
        >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
#echo "create_project_shared_repo_url : git@github.com:cjsteel/ansible-project-create_project.git'" \
#        >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
echo "create_project_testing         : False"            >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml

echo ""                                                    >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
cat roles/production/defaults/main.yml  | grep -v \\---    >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
cat roles/staging/defaults/main.yml     | grep -v \\---    >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
cat roles/development/defaults/main.yml | grep -v \\---    >> group_vars/all/create_project.yml
cat group_vars/all/create_project.yml

```

#### Customize global variables

If running everything locally you should at least change the following four variables in `group_vars/all/create_project.yml`:

```yaml

create_project_license_year: '2016'
create_project_author      : 'Christopher Steel'
create_project_license     : 'mit'
create_project_user        : 'cjs'

```

If you want to run against multiple hosts (dev, staging, production) you may want to make changes to  other variables and may need to make other adjustments to the scripts.

## Run your playbook

```shell

ansible-playbook systems.yml --ask-become-pass

```

## Testing results

Running the projects main playbook will run some tests as well. Testing results will be below this line:

Getting Started
===============

Ansible Controllers and Targets
-------------------------------

### user accounts

Ansible commands are executed on the Ansible Controller from an **unprivileged account** ``alice``. This user has an SSH key pair stored in ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` or has its SSH key available in the SSH Agent. An **administrator account** with the same name will be created on the remote host during the bootstrap process.

### The Ansible Controller

An Ansible controller is a physical or virtual system (running Ansible) that is used to automate and/or orchestrate the configuration of one or more targeted hosts via host inventories. 

Ansible has a rapidly growing collection of included and community contributed modules and roles that allow users to target a wide array of systems running various flavours of Linux, OS X, UNIX as well as those running Windows. This includes the more traditional platforms such as PC's, Servers and virtual machines in addition to switches, firewalls and other hardware running embedded operating systems.

Most Ansible modules use idempotent commands which ensure that the host is left in a particular state.

Unlike the majority of configuration automation and orchestration systems Ansible Controllers tend  to push out configurations rather than having hosts pull configuraton from controllers although using Ansilbe to pull configuration information is quite easy to do as well.

Ansible only requires that targeted hosts run an SSH server and a version of Python 2.x

Debian parcs and DebOps
-----------------------

If your parc is limited to Debian based hosts I would highly recommend investigating the exstensive and excellent collection of Ansible scripts started by Maciej Delmanowski of the Medical University of GdaÅ„sk.

Host Names
----------

Our script collection is used to target new workstations as well to maintain existing ones. As we currently do not have control of all of the DNS servers that we make use of we tend to avoid using fqdn to refer to them.

So rather than referring to a host as ``worstation-01.example.com`` we refer to it as ``worstation-01``.

Root or Sudo User
-----------------

Our bootstrap script requires that targeted systems have a root or sudo user with a password as well as an ssh server. For Debian based hosts you want setup the ssh server as follows:

   admin@ws-01:~$ sudo apt-get update
   admin@ws-01:~$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

The ``admin`` account requires a password as SSH keys are not installed yet.

Requirements
------------

Create an Unprivledged user
---------------------------

On the Ansible controller we will create a regular user without sudo.

### Ubuntu

```shell

sudo adduser aadams

```

Install Requirements
--------------------

### miniconda

```shell

mkdir -p ~/sys/sw/linux/miniconda/64/
cd ~/sys/sw/linux/miniconda/64/
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-4.2.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
# wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

```

### Checksums

#### Get checksum of downloaded file

```shell

md5sum Miniconda2-4.2.12-Linux-x86_64.sh > md5sum-Miniconda2-4.2.12-Linux-x86_64.txt
cat md5sum-Miniconda2-4.2.12-Linux-x86_64.txt

```

#### Download checksums

```shell

curl -sL https://repo.continuum.io/miniccurl -L https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/ | html2text -width 300  > md5sums.txt

```

#### Compare checksums

```shell

cat md5sums.txt | grep Miniconda2-4.2.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
cat md5sum-Miniconda2-4.2.12-Linux-x86_64.txt

```

### Install

bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b

### add to bashrc

```shell

# added by Miniconda2 4.2.12 installer
export PATH="/home/aadams/miniconda2/bin:$PATH"

```

### Test

Restart your terminal session then:

```shell

miniconda2/bin/conda list

```

## Create Ansible environment

This may take some time and requires an internet connection

```shell

    ANSIBLE_VERSION=1.9.0.1
    conda create -n ansible-$ANSIBLE_VERSION -c csteel ansible=$ANSIBLE_VERSION

```

### to activate

```shell

source activate ansible-1.9.0.1

```
### To deactivate

```shell

source deactivate

### Testing

```shell

ansible --version
ansible 1.9.0.1
  configured module search path = None

```

### Create an alias

```shell

touch  ~/.bash_aliases
nano  ~/.bash_aliases

```

#### add your alias

```shell

alias ansel1.9='source activate ansible-1.9.0.1'
alias stopansel1.9='source deactivate ansible-1.9.0.1'

```

#### source ~/.bash_aliases

```shell

. ~/.bash_aliases

# or

source ~/.bash_aliases

```

Creating an Ansible project
---------------------------

Begin by creating a project directory that will contains all of the data related to a given environment. This will include your Ansible inventory, Ansible password vault(s), custom playbooks and roles.

```shell

mkdir ~/projects/ace_testing
cd ~/projects/ace_testing

```

Install blank project

```shell

git clone https://github.com/csteel/project-ansible-ace.git

```
